#summary How to config the IsoAlgo Dimensioning Options.

== 1.Introduction ==
IsoAlgo can output several types of dimensions with different amounts of detail. The main types of dimensioning are: 
 * String dimensions(the default);
 * Composite dimensions;
 * Overall dimensions;
 * Support Dimensions;

The different types are illustrated in the following figure: <br>

== 2.Details ==
*String dimensions* are measured between the following points: 
 * The start or end of a branch;
 * Changes of direction(bends, elbows etc.);
 * Component connection points(flanges, welds, screwed and compression joints etc., excluding gaskets);

*Composite dimensioning* ignores dimensions which the fabricator has no control over, particularly the sizes of individual components. Component which are directly connected to each other are therefore dimensioned as though they constitute a single composite item. 

*Overall dimensions* indicate the lengths of the following sections of a pipeline: 
 * From the start of a branch to the first change of direction;
 * From each change diretion to the next;
 * From the last change of direction to the end of a Branch;
 * From the start of a falling section skew-box to the end of the falling section skew-box;
 * Between Branch connections.

In IsoAlgo you can config the dimensioning options by IsoAlgoConfig.xml. By choosing different representation for different dimension type: <br>
